# Global AI Workflow

This repository contains my global AI workflow.

[main-workflow-document.md](https://github.com/teren-papercutlabs/global-ai-workflow/blob/main/main-workflow-document.mdhttps:/) contains the documentation of my workflow.

The global-cursor-rules folder is a repository of my global cursor rules that are synced across projects using a custom vscode extension.
