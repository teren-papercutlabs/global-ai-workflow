# Project Document Template

This template provides a standardized structure for initial project documentation.

## Document Structure

The project document should be created at `/documentation/project-document.md` and follow this structure:

```markdown
# [Project Name]

## Project Overview
[Concise description of what the project is and its primary purpose]
- What problem does it solve?
- Who are the primary users/stakeholders?
- What is the expected impact?

## Problem Statement
[Clear description of the problem being solved, with quantitative data when available]
- Current pain points and challenges
- Inefficiencies in existing processes
- Costs (time, money, resources) of the current situation
- Impact on users/business
- Relevant metrics and data points

## Solution
[High-level description of your proposed solution]
- Core features and capabilities
- Key technical components
- Integration points
- User interaction flow
- Key technologies/frameworks used

## Project Scope
[Clear definition of what's in and out of scope]
- In scope:
  - Core features and functionality
  - Essential integrations
  - MVP requirements
- Out of scope:
  - Features for future consideration
  - Non-essential enhancements
  - Known limitations
- Future considerations:
  - Potential enhancements
  - Scalability considerations
  - Future integration possibilities
```

## Usage Guidelines

1. Keep the document focused on high-level planning and objectives
2. Use clear, concise language
3. Include specific metrics and data points when available
4. Separate technical implementation details into README.md
5. Update the document as project scope or requirements change

## Best Practices

1. Be specific and quantitative where possible
2. Include relevant stakeholder input
3. Keep technical details minimal - those belong in README.md
4. Focus on the "why" and "what" rather than the "how"
5. Use bullet points for better readability
6. Include actual metrics and data when available
