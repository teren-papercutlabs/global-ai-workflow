# Linear Project Configuration Setup

This rule guides the setup of Linear project configuration during project initialization.

## Configuration Process

1. Ask the user for Linear project information:
   - Project name (human-readable name)

2. Get team information:
   - Use `mcp_linear_linear_getTeams` to fetch available teams
   - If multiple teams exist, ask user to select the correct team
   - Store the selected team's ID

3. Get workflow states for the team:
   - Use `mcp_linear_linear_getWorkflowStates` with the team ID
   - Store all workflow states and their IDs

4. Get all available labels:
   - Use `mcp_linear_linear_getLabels` to fetch labels
   - Store all label IDs and names
   - Note the Cursor-generated label ID specifically

5. Get or create project:
   - Use `mcp_linear_linear_getProjects` to find existing project
   - If project doesn't exist, create it with `mcp_linear_linear_createProject`
   - Store the project ID

6. Create `.linear.json` configuration file:
```json
{
  "project": {
    "id": "<project-uuid>",
    "name": "<project-name>",
    "team_id": "<team-id>"
  },
  "ticket_defaults": {
    "labelIds": ["<cursor-label-id>"],
    "status": "Todo"
  },
  "metadata": {
    "workflow_states": [
      {
        "id": "<state-id>",
        "name": "<state-name>",
        "type": "<state-type>"
      }
    ],
    "labels": [
      {
        "id": "<label-id>",
        "name": "<label-name>"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

7. Verify Configuration:
   - Validate project UUID exists in Linear
   - Confirm project is accessible
   - Verify team ID is valid
   - Test basic Linear API connectivity
   - Verify all workflow states and labels are valid

## Implementation Details

1. The configuration file should be created at the project root
2. File permissions should be set appropriately
3. The file should be added to version control
4. The metadata section should be kept up to date with periodic syncs

## Error Handling

If configuration fails:
1. Log the error with specific details
2. Remove any partially created configuration
3. Provide clear instructions for manual setup if needed

## Metadata Maintenance

The metadata section containing workflow states and labels should be periodically updated to stay in sync with Linear:
1. Consider implementing a refresh mechanism
2. Update metadata when Linear configuration changes are detected
3. Provide utility functions to refresh metadata on demand
