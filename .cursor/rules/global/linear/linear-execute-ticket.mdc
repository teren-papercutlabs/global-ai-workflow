# Linear Ticket Execution Rule

This rule provides instructions for executing Linear tickets with proper logging and testing integration.

## Execution Steps

1. Ticket Information Retrieval
   - Use Linear MCP to fetch ticket details to work on
   - For workflow states, first check .linear.json in the metadata.workflow_states section
   - Only make API calls for workflow states if .linear.json is not available

2. Logging Integration
   - Use existing logging utility in the project
   - Follow logging standards in logging-standards.mdc

3. Testing Requirements
   - Follow testing standards from testing-standards.mdc
   - Write unit tests for ticket processing

4. Update ticket
   - Move status to 'in review'
