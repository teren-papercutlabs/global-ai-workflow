# Create Project Document

This rule guides the creation of the initial project documentation following the standardized template.
IMPORTANT: do NOT jump to writing the project documentaiton. The first step is to ask me a series of comprehensive questions to establish the required context as described below.

## Required Information

Before creating the project document, gather the following information:

1. Project Overview
   - No specific questions here, the summary of the below questions should act as the project overview

2. Problem Details
   - Current challenges and pain points, and any metrics/data to quantify
   - Cost implications of current situation
   - Impact on users/business

3. Solution Approach
   - Core features and capabilities
   - Key technical components
   - Integration requirements
   - Technology stack decisions

4. Scope Definition
   - Core requirements
   - MVP features
   - Out-of-scope items
   - Future considerations

## Implementation Process

1. Create the documentation directory:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p documentation
   ```

2. Use the template from [project-document-template.mdc](../planning/project-document-template.mdc) to create `/documentation/project-document.md`

3. Follow the template structure, ensuring all sections are properly filled out

4. Review and validate the document content

## Best Practices

1. Be specific and quantitative where possible
2. Include actual data and metrics
3. Keep technical details in README.md
4. Focus on clarity and conciseness
5. Update as project requirements evolve

## Verification Steps

1. Ensure all template sections are completed
2. Verify metrics and data points are accurate
3. Confirm scope is clearly defined
4. Check that technical details are minimal
5. Validate with stakeholders if possible
