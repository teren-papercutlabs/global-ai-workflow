# Creating Global Cursor Rules

This rule guides the creation of new global cursor rules that will be shared across all projects.

## Rule Location

Global cursor rules must be created in:
```
/home/teren41/environment/global-ai-workflow/.cursor/rules/global-cursor-rules/
```

The query might specify some subdirectory to be used, that should be found/created within the folder above

## Implementation Process

1. Create the rule file in the global rules directory specified above
3. Validate the rule format according to [cursor-rule-instructions.mdc](cursor-rule-instructions.mdc)
4. Provide feedback on the creation process

In case of errors, any partially created files will be cleaned up.

## Additional Information

For detailed instructions on rule format, structure, and best practices, please refer to [cursor-rule-instructions.mdc](cursor-rule-instructions.mdc).
