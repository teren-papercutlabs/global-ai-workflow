# Cursor Rule Creation Instructions

This document contains the common instructions and best practices for creating any type of Cursor rule.

## Rule Structure

1. File Format:
   - Use `.mdc` extension
   - Follow kebab-case naming convention
   - Include YAML frontmatter
   - Use markdown for content

2. YAML Frontmatter Requirements:
   ```yaml
   ---
   description: Optional - Short description of the rule's purpose
   globs: Optional - File patterns to apply the rule to
   alwaysApply: Required - true/false
   ---
   ```

3. Frontmatter Rules:
   - If `alwaysApply: true`:
     - No description or globs needed
   - If `alwaysApply: false`:
     - Must include either description or globs
     - Cannot include both

## Example Rule Format

```markdown
---
description: How to format TypeScript files
globs: **/*.ts
alwaysApply: false
---

## Best Practices

1. Make rule names descriptive and specific
2. Keep descriptions concise but informative
3. Use globs when the rule should only apply to specific file types
4. Use description when the rule requires agent decision-making
5. Use alwaysApply: true for rules that should always be enforced
