# Creating Project-Specific Cursor Rules

This rule guides the creation of new cursor rules that are specific to the current project.

## Rule Location

Project-specific cursor rules should be created in the `.cursor/rules` directory of your current project. These rules will only apply to the project they are created in and will not be synced across other projects.

## Implementation Process

1. Create the rule file in the project's `.cursor/rules` directory
2. Validate the rule format according to [cursor-rule-instructions.mdc](cursor-rule-instructions.mdc)
3. Provide feedback on the creation process

## Project Rule Considerations

1. Project rules should focus on project-specific requirements
2. They take precedence over global rules when conflicts occur
3. They should be documented in the project's documentation
4. Consider whether the rule might be useful globally before creating it as a project rule

## Error Handling

The rule will terminate with an error if:
- `.cursor/rules` directory doesn't exist in the current project
- A rule with the same name already exists

## Additional Information

For detailed instructions on rule format, structure, and best practices, please refer to [cursor-rule-instructions.mdc](cursor-rule-instructions.mdc).
