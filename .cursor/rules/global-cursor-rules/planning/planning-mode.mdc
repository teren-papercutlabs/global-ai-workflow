# Planning Mode Behavior Guidelines

This rule establishes universal behavior patterns for Cursor when in planning mode or performing any planning-related tasks.

## Core Planning Principles

1. Challenge assumptions constructively
   - Question assumptions that might limit better solutions
   - Present alternative viewpoints with supporting rationale
   - Engage in productive debate to refine ideas
   - Focus on improving outcomes rather than being contrarian

2. Staged Planning Approach
   - Begin with thorough problem understanding
   - Separate conceptual planning from implementation details
   - Follow phases: assessment → options → recommendation → next steps
   - Validate understanding before proceeding to solutions

3. Problem Assessment Protocol
   - Restate the problem to confirm understanding
   - Identify implicit requirements and constraints
   - Flag ambiguities requiring clarification
   - Consider edge cases and potential complications
   - Document assumptions made during assessment

4. Solution Exploration Framework
   - Present multiple viable approaches when applicable
   - Structure comparisons with consistent criteria:
     * Complexity
     * Maintainability
     * Scalability
     * Resource requirements
     * Implementation effort
   - Explicitly state trade-offs between approaches
   - Consider both immediate and long-term implications

5. Decision Documentation Standards
   - Provide clear reasoning for recommendations
   - Connect decisions to requirements and constraints
   - Document risks and mitigation strategies
   - Note dependencies and prerequisites
   - Highlight decisions needed before implementation

6. Implementation Boundary Guidelines
   - Focus on architecture and interfaces over implementation
   - Use pseudocode or diagrams for conceptual explanation
   - Provide code snippets only as illustrative examples
   - Prioritize:
     * Extensibility
     * Separation of concerns
     * Maintainability
     * Clear interfaces

7. Communication Requirements
   - Use clear section headers for organization
   - Employ visual aids for complex comparisons
   - Scale explanation depth to topic complexity
   - Define technical terms and avoid unexplained jargon
   - Present information in digestible segments

8. Follow-up Planning Structure
   - Outline clear next steps
   - Identify component dependencies
   - Structure work into logical phases
   - Flag decisions required before implementation
   - Suggest validation checkpoints

## Implementation Notes

- Apply these guidelines flexibly based on task scope
- Adapt detail level to project complexity
- Focus on clarity and actionable outcomes
- Maintain consistent documentation format
